### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;"> Leon Battista Alberti is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450. The vane anemometer is an instrument which uses this principle to indirectly calculate air velocity by calculating distance rotated by the vanes within a fixed time period. When held in a moving air stream, the air passing through the instrument exerts a force on the angled vanes, causing them to rotate with an angular velocity that is closely proportional to the air speed. A gearing mechanism and clutch arrangement couple the vanes to a pointer which rotates against a circular dial calibrated in meters. The instrument is used in conjunction with a stopwatch and actually indicates the number of "meter of air" that have passed through the anemometer during a given time period. The clutch device is employed to stop and start the pointer while the vanes continue to rotate. A zero reset lever is also incorporated into the instrument.

#### Specifications

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Vane anemometer is also known as propeller anemometer. The Vane Anemometer have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Low range vane anemometer will typically have eight vanes, jeweled bearings and give velocity reading in the range of 0.25- 15 m/sec. High range instruments may have four vanes, low friction roller or ball bearings and can be capable of measuring air velocities as high as 50m/sec. The vanes are set at an angle of 0.785 radians to the direction of air flow. Anemometers commonly used in mines cover a velocity range of 1-15m/sec.

##### Purpose of Vane Anemometer:
1.	It is used to find air velocity at different locations in a mine. Table given below tell us about maximum air velocities at different locations.

| S.No | LOCATION |   Maximum air velocity (m/sec)|
|---|---|---|
| 1 |   Ventilation shafts not provided with winding equipment; fan drift.| 15|
| 2 |	Ventilation shafts where man winding is not carried out, or hoisting shafts only.|12|
| 3 |	Shafts used for man winding or man hoisting shafts and haulage roads.|08|
| 4 |	Other roadways.|06|
| 5 |	Conveyor roads, loading points and transfer points.|04|
| 6 |	Working faces in developing or depillaring/stopping areas, including longwall faces.|04|

2.	Based on degree of gassiness of coal mine, different air velocities are required at different places in coal mine. To measure that also we need vane anemometer. Table given below provide information about that.

Degree of gassiness| Place where velocity of air is to be measured |Minimum velocity of air (m/min)
---|---|---
I degree | Immediate outbye ventilation connection from the face.| 30
II degree |a. 4.5 m from any faces, whether working or discontinued, on the intake side of the brattice or partition.<br> b. 7.5 m outbye of the discharge end of an air pipe. At maximum pan of the longwall face.<br>c. At maximum pan of the longwall face.| 30<br><br>15<br><br>60
III degree |a. 4.5 m from any faces, whether working or discontinued, on the intake side of the brattice or partition.<br> b. 7.5 m outbye of the discharge end of an air pipe.	At maximum pan of the longwall face.<br>c. At maximum pan of the longwall face.| 45<br><br>25<br><br>75
